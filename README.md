Custom Conveyor simulation for ROS2 humble

The conveyor model in this repository is based on the work developed by the IFRA (Intelligent Flexible Robotics and Assembly) Group, part of the Centre for Robotics and Assembly at Cranfield University.

The IFRA Group pushes technical boundaries by providing high-tech automation and assembly solutions, supporting smart manufacturing with Smart Industry technologies and solutions. Their work in Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) has been instrumental in driving the transition towards flexible, intelligent, and responsive automation systems.

This repository includes an improved version of the conveyor model originally developed by the IFRA Group. The enhancements build upon their innovative research and dedication to designing Intelligent, Responsive, and Flexible automation solutions.
